# Project Management System for Colleges

## 1. Introduction

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to create a centralized web application for managing student projects in a college environment. It aims to encourage a culture of hands-on learning by providing a platform where students can register, showcase their work, and track their progress.

### Background
In tier-2 & 3 colleges, students often lack the opportunity and culture to gain hands-on experience in project-building. This platform addresses that gap by fostering collaboration, improving transparency, and helping students showcase their work to peers, teachers, and recruiters.

### Scope
The project will include:
- A centralized repository for student projects.
- Features for students to post, update, and complete projects.
- Admin functionality for project approval and public showcasing.
- Support for individual and team-based projects.
- Tools for creating sprints and managing project timelines.
- Analytics and dashboards to track student performance.

## 2. Problem Statement

- **Problem Definition**: Students in tier-3 colleges lack a platform to track, showcase, and collaborate on projects effectively. This hinders their exposure and preparedness for the industry.
- **Importance**: Providing a structured platform will:
  - Improve project-building culture.
  - This platform will help juniors and colleagues understand what their seniors are building.
  - Colleges can showcase these projects directly to recruiters and MNCs, enhancing visibility and opportunities.
  - Enable students to showcase their work to recruiters.
  - Encourage collaboration and learning from senior projects.
